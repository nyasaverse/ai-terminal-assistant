# 🤖 AI Terminal Assistant (Python)

This is a simple terminal-based AI assistant built using Python as part of my learning journey in AI.

The assistant works through text input and provides responses accordingly.

## ✨ Current Features

- Takes text input from the user via terminal
- Responds to basic friendly conversations such as:
  - "How are you?"
  - "I am tired"
  - "I feel sad"
  - "I am emotional"
  - "Motivate me"
- Opens common platforms when asked, such as:
  - Netflix
  - Spotify

- When the assistant cannot directly answer a question, it redirects the query to Google and helps the user find answers there.
